        <h1>Electronique</h1>
        <p class="text">Electronics is a branch of applied physics, «which is interested in electrical conduction phenomena and associated equipments1». It deals with “the movement of charge carriers in vacuum, gases and semiconductors, the resulting electrical conduction phenomena, and their applications2”.</p>

        <p class="text">We speak of electronics especially when the electrical circuits include amplifiers and especially semiconductors. In principle, the term electrotechnics covers all applications of electricity, but in French the fields of telecommunications and information technology3 are excluded, which is thus considered to be the exclusive domain of electronics. <br>
        The electronics professions are divided into fairly specialized fields, each of which is a field of study: digital electronics, power electronics, etc </p>
        <h2>Generalities</h2>
        <p class="text" >Electronics is a technical discipline or engineering science, one of the most important branches of applied physics, auxiliary in most industries. <br> The electronic word, which first refers to facts and theories relating to the electron, took on a technical meaning in the middle of the 20th century. The inventors who developed the industries and techniques that use electricity—telegraph, electric lighting, electric motor, telephone, radiocommunication—worked empirically, while the scientists developed an electronic theory of matter. The notion of “electronic device” arises from the classification of radio detection devices, the main ones being the crystal receiver, a semiconductor whose theory is then “incompletely knowed4” and the last the “electronic detector”., the principle of which is directly related to the flow of electrons from the heated cathode. This electronic tube allows amplification, which quickly take advantage of many applications. Some, such as broadcasting, will broadcast their products to the general public. This invention marks, for most authors, the beginning of electronics as speciality5. <br> Quantum physics provides the elements to understand how semiconductors work. The discovery of the transistor effect around 19476, then the manufacture of solid state circuits separate the current sense of «electronics» from the particle electron. Usage considers phenomena involving electronic flows, such as arc and corona effect and their applications, as out of the scope of electronic2. <br> The state of electronics in electrical engineering—all electricity applications—is unclear. The use of semiconductors is sometimes a criterion1, other authors consider that electrical engineering deals with the transfer of power, while electronics studies the <br> Dr. Hocine AIT SAADI <br> Head of electronics department <br> electronics department</p>

        <p class="text">The electronics department is among the oldest departments of the BLIDA 1 university. It currently has 50 teachers, between professors, lecturers A and B, and assistant teachers. It is considered to be one of the most attractive departments for students from the science and technology common core curriculum, with more than 1,000 students in the various cycles and specialties offered.</p>
        <h2>The training courses offered</h2>
        <p class="text" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">The training offered is part of the LMD higher education reforms. They aim to train competent scientific executives in specialties of biomedical engineering, electronics and telecommunications. <br> The department offers three LMD courses and has six masters and three doctoral courses:</p>
